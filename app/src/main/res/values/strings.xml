    <string name="helpIntro">Welcome to PantryMate, the inventory organisation app. Our aim is to make your life easier by summarising what food you have at home and when it will expire. There are a few different ways for food items to be added or removed from your online pantry, this help page will show you how each one works.</string>
    <string name="helpEdit">Edit: The edit page is used to manually change the information inside your pantry. Add allows you to put new items in your pantry. This requires you to input the food item(s) name, quantity of the item and the items expiry date. Edit lets you change information on the items that are already in the database. Remove allows you to manually remove an item from the pantry.</string>
    <string name="helpCamera">Camera: Take a picture of your food items using your phone’s camera, and the app will add those items automatically to your pantry. For better results, make sure the room is well lit, the food items are spaced apart and that the packaging doesn’t obscure what the food looks like. (work in progress)</string>
    <string name="helpBarcode">Barcode: Use your phone camera to scan the barcode of your food items. The app will then add those items automatically to your pantry. (work in progress)</string>
